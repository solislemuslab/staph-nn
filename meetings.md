# Initial meeting
Rules of the game:
- Need to study: https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming
- Document everything you do clearly (in Rmd or jupyter notebook)
- Make sure your code is commented and easy to understand for others
- Keep most updated version in github
- Do not push data, PDF, images or big files to github
- Feel free to email or schedule meetings ahead of time if problems arise, always better to ask questions sooner!

# Meeting 11/22

- Junting and I met with Jon Moller for description of data files (`notebook.md`)
- next steps agreed on: Junting will play around with neural network architectures
