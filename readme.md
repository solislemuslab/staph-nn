# Steps to clone the repo locally

1. In the terminal, go to the folder where you want to put the local repository using cd

2. Type:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/solislemuslab/staph-nn.git
```
3. Inside this folder, create a subfolder called `data` where you will put the data. This folder is ignored in the `.gitignore` file, so nothing inside this folder will be pushed to github
