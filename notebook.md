## Data

Main data to analyze, from Jon Moller email:

Attached are two .zip files containing the phage resistance phenotype for each phage and the presence/absence of significant SNPs, COGs, and k-mers (determined by the GWAS for each phage). The files either contain a quantitative phage resistance phenotype (0 is sensitive while 1 or more is resistant) or a qualitative phage resistance phenotype (0 is sensitive, 1 is semi-sensitive, and 2 is resistant). The row names are strains while the column names are the features or the phenotype (pheno). Files with "STCC" in the name include sequence type (ST) and clonal complex (CC) as additional predictors (columns).


Files:
- `phage_qual.zip`
- `phage_quant.zip`


## Next steps
- meeting with Jon to discuss the data:
    - understand the columns
    - which one is the response?
    - why multiple files?
